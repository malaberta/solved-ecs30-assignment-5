In this assignment, you will download Program5Source.zip and complete the code fragments as described below.

Problem 1: deletespaces.c

I this problem you will write a program that reads a string, deletes any whitespace from the string, and prints the result back to the user. Read the string using fgets, a safe way to read in strings. To read a string of length at most n into char* str, use the following: fgets(str, n + 1, stdin);

Generally, fgets is used to read a string from a file, but using stdin as the third argument causes fgets to read a string from stdin instead. Example output:

Enter a max string length: 99

Enter the string to delete whitespace from: The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog Result:

Enter a max string length: 20

Enter the string to delete whitespace from: a bcd ef g hi

Result: abcdefghi

Problem 2: matrixaddition.c (50 points, 5 per test case)

In this problem you will implement integer matrix addition. This will require you to dynamically allocate space for a 2 dimensional array. An example of matrix addition is:

In general, if <em>A </em>and <em>B </em>are matrices with the same number of rows and columns, then their sum <em>C </em>= <em>A </em>+ <em>B </em>is defined by <em>C</em>[<em>i</em>][<em>j</em>] = <em>A</em>[<em>i</em>][<em>j</em>] + <em>B</em>[<em>i</em>][<em>j</em>]. Here, <em>A</em>[<em>i</em>][<em>j</em>] is the integer in the <em>i</em><sup>th </sup>row and <em>j</em><sup>th </sup>column of <em>A</em>. In the example above, <em>A</em>[1][1] = 1, <em>A</em>[1][3] = 3, and <em>A</em>[2][2] = 8.

This program has been partially written for you in matrixaddition.c. Write the body of functions that are marked with a comment that begins with

// Homework TODO: â€¦

Do not modify other parts of the code. Example output:
